* About 

Ansible is a configuration management tool that I use to automate the installation and configuration of all the software on my computer.

Ansible was developed by Red Hat Inc., which is now a subsidiary of IBM.

* Installation

I developed this configuration for personal use so it may not work perfectly in your case. I recommend that you use it as a base when building your own configuration rather than installing it directly.

  $ sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/zoliky/ansible.git
